                            The California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) requires People Caddie to disclose how it responds to Do Not Track signals set in a User’s browser.  People Caddie supports Do Not Track browser settings.  If you enable Do Not Track privacy settings in the browser you are using, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop collecting the information that allows us to tailor the Services to User preferences based on Users recent use of the Services.  Consequently, we will not store or use information about any other websites you visit, other than our Sites.
